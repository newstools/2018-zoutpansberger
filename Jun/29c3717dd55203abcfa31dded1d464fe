Motorists traveling on the N1 north between Louis Trichardt and Musina are warned that they could experience traffic delays due to an accident at the first Witvlag turn-off heading over the Soutpansberg mountain pass. The traffic delays are caused by a heavy vehicle which partly overturned on the notorious hairpin bend at the turn-off. According to eyewitnesses at the scene, one lane is completely blocked off for traffic, causing somewhat of a severe traffic jam. The accident occurred at around 16:00 this afternoon. By the time of going to press, it was uncertain if the truck had been removed and the normal traffic flow restored.
