Limpopo government is in mourning, following the death of Agricultural MEC Joyce Mashamba. Mashamba passed away last Wednesday, June 20, at the age of 67, following her long-time illness. Happy Joyce Mashamba was born on September 25, 1950, in Mulamula, near Mdavula village in Vhembe. She was married to ANC stalwart Tintswalo Godwin George Mashamba. Since 1994, Mashamba was an MEC in different portfolios, such as education; safety, security and liaison; sport, arts and culture; social development and agriculture. Premier Stanley Mathabatha described the passing of Mashamba as a big loss to the province, government and the party. Mathabatha said Mashamba’s passing left a big void, because of the contribution she always provided as a senior party member and a veteran in his cabinet. He extended his condolences to her family. Mashamba will be buried at her home village of Mulamula on Saturday during an official provincial funeral.
