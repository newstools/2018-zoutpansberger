The police in Limpopo’s relentless efforts in eradicating the existence of illegal explosives paid dividends on Thursday evening with the arrest of seven suspects en route to Gauteng. According to provincial police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, the arrests follow a joint operation by various police units at the border and from Musina. Ngoepe said that the seven suspects aged between 32 and 39, including a woman, were apprehended after their suspicious behaviour caught the police’s attention and their vehicle was stopped and searched. During the search, 50 fused explosive caps and 10 blasting cartridges were confiscated. “The origin of these explosives is still being determined, although it is believed that this might be part of a bigger syndicate,” said Ngoepe. He said that it is suspected that the explosives were destined to be used in business and armed robberies where safes were to be blown up. “But the ongoing police investigations will tell,” said Ngoepe. At the time of going to press, the suspects were yet to appear before the Musina Magistrate Court on charges relating to the illegal possession of explosives and contraventions of the Immigration Act.

In the meantime, the police’s acting provincial commissioner, Major General Jan Scheepers, has applauded the police units for their sterling job in arresting the suspects. “The commitment of the men and women in blue continue yielding results in eliminating explosives that are commonly utilised during said crime categories. This is a sign to the criminals out there that no stone will be left unturned In Limpopo in dealing head-on with any violent crime including the trio-crimes,” said Scheepers.
