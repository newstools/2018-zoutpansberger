With the closing of Robot Electric in Louis Trichardt at the end of July, parents might have been wondering where they would be able to purchase school uniforms in the future as easily as they have always done. They need not wonder, however, and will be very happy to hear about the opening of the Triegie Winkel sometime between mid to late August this year, right on the grounds of Louis Trichardt High School. Ms Madeleine Nel, the school’s communication liaison, shared the details. She said the chairman of the school-governing body, Mr Rampie Gilfillan, together with the board, decided to take over Robot’s school-clothing department as a service to the community. At present, workers are hard at work during this school break to clear out and outfit what used to be the music room, to house the clothing shop. It will be conveniently situated as one enters the main school gate. Even though the new shop is situated on the school grounds, it will be run as a completely separate entity. “Triegie Winkel will have its own staff and management and operate during regular shop hours. The shop will be the official distributor of school uniforms for Louis Trichardt and Soutpansberg primary schools, as well as for Louis Trichardt High. Sports outfits for the high school will be available, and future team sponsors will find all the help they need when sourcing items such as bags and apparel for supporters,” said Madeleine. Madeleine said she would update residents at a later stage as to the exact date of the small opening ceremony for the Triegie Winkel, as well as news on other possible apparel and products to come at relevant times, including an alumni range and memorabilia. “Many thanks to Ms Chrissie Pohl for all her help with the transfer process,” said Madeleine.
