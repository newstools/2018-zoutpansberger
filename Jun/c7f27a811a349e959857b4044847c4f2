A dark cloud of mourning hangs over the Limpopo Province, following the death of one of its longest serving MECs, Ms Happy Joyce Mashamba. Mashamba, of Mankweng, passed away on Wednesday after an extended illness. Tributes following her passing started pouring in early on Thursday. One of the first people to send his condolences to the family was Limpopo Premier, Mr Stan Mathabatha, who described her death as a great loss to the family, the province, and the country. A statement issued by the premier’s spokesperson, Mr Kenny Mathivha, says that Mathabatha has learnt with sadness of the passing of MEC Mashamba. The statement described Mashamba as one of the most senior politicians in Mathabatha’s executive committee who, serving in various capacities and portfolios, executed her responsibilities with diligence and persistance. Mathabatha said that although infirm in the past few years, Mashamba continued to work until her last days. "We will miss her,” the statement reads. Mashamba served in the departments of education, safety, security and liaison, sport, arts and culture, social development and was serving as MEC for Agriculture at the time of her passing.
