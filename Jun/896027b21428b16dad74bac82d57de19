A local resident, Mr Glen Netshifhefhe, is very upset with the Makhado Municipality and he wants to hold the Council responsible for the damage inflicted on his luxury car. Netshifhefhe drove into a large hole next to Anderson Street last Thursday and his Jaguar was extensively damaged. Netshifhefhe explained this week that it was misty when he drove along Anderson Street. He said that street lights were also not working, making the area even darker. While driving along, he suddenly heard a crashing sound and then he ended up next to a tree. He realised afterwards that he had hit a huge hole that had been left open by municipal workers. He is very grateful for having survived the incident, but reckons that more should have been done to safeguard the area and indicate the danger. Netshifhefhe complained that no warning signs had been erected and that the open hole posed a danger to motorists and pedestrians. He now plans on suing the municipality and making them pay for the damage to his vehicle. The spokesperson for the Makhado Municipality, Mr Louis Bobodi, explained that workers from the municipality were busy fixing water pipes next to the street and had to dig the hole to get to the pipes. According to the information he had received, the necessary road signs had been put up to warn motorists of the danger. Bobodi said that Mr Netshifhefhe had gone to the municipality to report the incident and he had allegedly admitted that he had been driving at a high speed when the car had hit the hole. The fact that visibility is low when there is mist in the mornings makes it so much more important to drive cautiously, Bobodi said. Bobodi invited Netshifhefhe to contact the municipality and bring along the quote to fix the vehicle, along with details of any insurance claims in this regard. The option of referring it to the relevant insurers can then be discussed.
