Residents should take note that several of Louis Trichardt’s streets will be closed for traffic during the Jacaranda FM Kremetart Cycling Race this weekend. The event will be hosted from the B hockey field of High School Louis Trichardt. Participants of the 175km, 70km and 35km road cycling race will start and finish in Anderson Street, in front of the high school. This will entail that Anderson (between Ruh and Louis Botha Street) as well as Heystek Street will be closed between 05:00 and 17:00. Spectators will be allowed to cross from Anderson into Ruh Street to access the parking area entrance in Hospital Street. In respect of the 175km race, sections of Stubbs Street to the N1 circle will be closed from 06:00 to 08:00. The N1 from the circle, to the Witvlag, Bluegumspoort and Waterpoort turn-offs will be closed from 06:00 to 09:00. The same goes for the Dzanani and Nzhelele turn-off roads. Where the race turns to Waterpoort, the road will be closed from 06:00 to 11:00. Regarding the 70km and 35km races, regulated traffic control will be from 08:00 to 17:00 in Anderson to Rissik Street and from Rissik onto the Vivo road. However, from 15:00 to 17:00 this section will be closed again for motorists in anticipation of returning participants in the 175km race. Mountain bikers will be able to show their skills during the Limpopo Mountain Bike XCO race on Sunday, 10 June. Racing will take place in the forestry area, which means that traffic in town will not be affected. Registrations for the race will open at 06:00 and the first races will start from 08:00 at the Komatiland offices in the Hanglip Forest. This race is a qualifier race for those cyclists who want to qualify for their Limpopo cycling colours.
