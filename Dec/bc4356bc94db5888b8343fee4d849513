The Soutpansberg Cycling Club’s annual Jingle Bell Toy Ride will take place on Friday, 7 December. To take part in the ride, all cyclists have to do is bring along a soft toy as entry fee. “They must also remember to decorate their bikes to bring out the Christmas spirit. The use of Christmas lights is preferable and remember, no helmet, no ride,” said the cycling’s club’s Stanley Thompson. The main aim of the ride is to both spread some Christmas cheer, as well as collect soft toys for less fortunate children. Prior to the ride, residents were invited to support the project by dropping off soft toys at each of the five participating businesses before 7 December, including Mike’s Kitchen, Thompson’s Motors, Mount Fuji Motors, Ocean Basket, the Zoutpansberg Private Hospital and Werda Motors. “At each of these businesses’ reception area will be a collection box in which residents can place the soft toys,” said Stanley. On the night of the ride, cyclist will visit each of these businesses mentioned above in the same order to collect the toys. The ride will start at 18:00 for 18:30 in the parking area at Makhado Crossing. “Bring your family and friends and join in the festivities,” invites the club. Back-up vehicles will be available.
