Cllr Samuel Munyai was sworn in as the acting mayor of Makhado Local Municipality at a special council meeting last Friday. The former mayor, Cllr Shonisani Sinyosi, was sacked with six other mayors by Premier Stan Mathabatha last Tuesday, after they were implicated in the VBS saga. Makhado Municipality invested more than R60 million with the VBS Mutual Bank. Munyai was sworn in by Magistrate Kwena Molokomme. Munyai is a former teacher and has been a councillor at the Makhado Municipality for the past 13 years. In accepting his position, Munyai said he would strive to ensure that the council, the administration and the community pulled together. He promised that the municipality would be “a shining example of how public participation can enhance the implementation of government policies and programmes aimed at community development”. He urged the councillors, administrative staff and Makhado community to be prepared to work as a unit “because united we stand, and divided we fall”. He said his policy, like those of his colleagues, would be one of an open door where he would listen to all the people and stakeholders who stood to benefit and were willing to contribute to development. He thanked former Mayor Sinyosi for “having laid a good foundation on which we will continue to serve our people effectively”. Munyai said he was comforted and strengthened by the realization that he would be leading a collective of leaders who were committed to working together and striving towards making the life of the community better. EFF councillor Isaac Bulala congratulated Munyai on his appointment and said that he hoped the new mayor would restore good governance in the municipality. DA councillor Alfred Mafhara thanked the new acting mayor for pointing out that he would adhere to the principle of putting the people first.
