The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has issued a reminder to recipients of social grants that from January 2019 they will not be able to draw their money with the old white SASSA cards. They stateÂ that to ensure that you do get your January grant you must get the new gold card before 14 December this year or provide your personal banking details to SASSA by completing the relevant form. This deadline will not be extended and SASSA has urged grant recipients still using the old card to take their identity document and old card to any SASSA or Post Office to get the new gold card without delay.
