Louis Trichardt Cricket Club’s premier league side scored a 31-run victory against the team from Nkowankowa on Sunday. The match was played in Louis Trichardt and the home side batted first. They were off to a good start, thanks to contributions by Nimesh Watekar (19), Leon Olwage (45) and Salauddin Patel (25). Leon Furstenburg added 16 runs, but it was left to Warno Smit to do the damage. He scored a brilliant 56 from just 32 balls. Christo Gerber (21 not out) helped him to take the score to 204/10 after 35 overs. Nkowankowa’s most successful bowler was Chris Mathebula, who took 4/43 in 10 overs. Artwell Mokgoloboto took 2/53 and Thomas Ngwenya took 2/8. Nkowankowa’s batsmen were determined to chase down the score and were off to a good start, thanks to opener Nhlanhla Shikwambana, who scored 51 from 82 balls. He found some support in Lethabo Phakula (12) and Lungi Mhlongo (16), but the pressure of seeing wickets fall around him seemed to be too much. Thomas Ngwenya (25) and Lordwick Mhlongo (13) put up a good fight, but Louis Trichardt’s bowlers kept applying pressure. The last wicket fell in the 44th over with the score on 173. Gerhardus Fourie was by far the home side’s best bowler. This young speedster took 4/30 in his eight overs. Wouter Smit was not only effective by taking three wickets, but in his six overs he only conceded 11 runs. On Sunday, Louis Trichardt play on their home ground against Hornbill Cricket Club. Nkowankowa will travel to Polokwane to play against Aces.
