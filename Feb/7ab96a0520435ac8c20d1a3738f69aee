MC Mining, previously known as CoaL of Africa Limited, has received all the necessary approvals to restart the Vele colliery. Vele’s original integrated-water-use licence (IWUL) was granted in March 2011 for a period of five years. Later, the company decided to apply for an amendment as a result of planned modifications to Vele’s coal-processing plant. Amendments were required to obtain approval relating to a diversion of a non-perennial stream and associated infrastructural activities. The Department of Water and Sanitation granted the licence on Tuesday. “We welcome this decision and the securing of all the regulatory authorisations for the colliery, said MC Mining CEO David Brown on Tuesday. He is confident that the department’s decision is a confirmation of the government’s support of MC Mining’s co-existence model. Brown explained that the co-existence model facilitates the co-existence of mining, agriculture and heritage land uses in line with the historic biodiversity offset agreement between the Department of Environmental Affairs, South African National Parks and MC Mining. Mining at Vele is not expected to start immediately. According to MC Mining, the final decision on whether to proceed with the plant modifications at Vele will first be placed before the company’s board for consideration. This will include a re-evaluation of all options available to the company, including an assessment of long-term coal pricing, as well as logistic consideration. “The board will evaluate all options available, which will be communicated at the appropriate time,” said Brown.
