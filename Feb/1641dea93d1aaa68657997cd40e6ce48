On Tuesday, 13 February 2018, a ground-breaking venture between Limpopo farmers and the Mark Fish Foundation (MFF) was launched by Mark Fish in Polokwane. At an Agritable event of Agri Limpopo at Bolivia Lodge, attended by banks, insurance companies, agriculture input providers, agri businesses, the SAPS, the CCMA, DAFF, farmers’ organizations, Women’s Agricultural Union, farmers and friends of Limpopo agriculture, Fish announced the project that “will use the game of soccer to build relationships on farms, give hope to workers and the youth, develop life skills and scout for soccer talent on farms and in rural areas in general”. “The project will be known as the Game of Stars Project. The initial survey amongst farmers in Limpopo has drawn interest from no fewer than 80 existing farm-soccer teams. After the announcement, indications are that this number may well double prior to the first finals to be played in August 2018,” said Agri SA in a press release. According to Mark Fish, the shortened version of soccer, which the project will be based upon, called “Fast Footie”, will grow spectator numbers. This version of soccer makes for a faster, more entertaining game. In this tournament, players will play for 20 minutes per side, with a powerplay of five minutes called by the respective captains of the teams. During the powerplay, three players of the opposing team will be asked to leave the field. Goals scored from further out than the 18-meter circle will count as two goals. Penalties will be scored by hitting the cross bar of the goal post of an undefended goal box. “We are committed to developing and training team coaches, game officials, team managers and players alike,” said Fish. “Although we are going to play soccer, we are focusing on the people and families involved with the game. Every individual deserves the chance to become the best person possible. This is our aim,” added Fish.
