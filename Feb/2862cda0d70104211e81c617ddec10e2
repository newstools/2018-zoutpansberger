The newspaper has just confirmed that Louis Trichardt’s water reservoirs are completely empty. According to sources within the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM), the reservoirs are empty due to a “sit down” by employees of the Makhado Municipality’s electrical department. Employees within this department are currently on a go-slow while demanding their outstanding overtime pay-outs. In some areas, residents have been without municipal water for almost two weeks. Makhado municipal officials could not give any indication of how the negotiation process between the municipality and their employees are progressing. Give us your views on this. Updates will be made available as the situation changes.
