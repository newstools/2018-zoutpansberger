Main Line Passenger Services, the long-distance passenger rail service of PRASA (Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa), has announced the re-introduction of the train service between Johannesburg and Musina (via Polokwane), effective 28 February. According to PRASA, this service was withdrawn in 2014 as a result of the rationalisation of train services; however, due to popular demand, Main Line Passenger Services decided to reinstate the service. The train will cater for Polokwane, Louis Trichardt, Musina and Zimbabwean customers crossing the border. “Shosholoza Meyl was inundated with requests from customers, pleading for the return of the service. Management evaluated the request thoroughly and reached a decision to reinstate the service. This comes in light of supporting the PRASA corporate plan to transport our customers at an affordable cost. All this can be experienced from as little as R100 for Economy (Sitter) Class and R160 for Tourist (sleeper) Class,” said Mr Mthuthuzeli Swartz, acting PRASA rail CEO, in a press release. This journey between Johannesburg and Polokwane takes eight hours and the journey to Musina, 10 hours from departure. PRASA said security would be available on board to ensure all customers enjoy a pleasant and safe experience. The train will have a dining car that provides meals, tea or coffee and refreshments at an affordable price. The train stops at intermediate stations such as Germiston, Pretoria, Hammanskraal, Bela Bela, Naboomspruit, Mokopane, Polokwane, Soekmekaar, Louis Trichardt and Mopani. The Shosholoza Meyl train will depart from Johannesburg on 28 February at 17:15 to arrive in Polokwane on Thursday at 01:15. It will depart back to Johannesburg at 22:35 the same morning. On 2 March, the train will again depart from Johannesburg at 17:15 to arrive in Musina on 3 March at 08:45, from where it will again depart back to Johannesburg at 15:25. These trips will take place on a weekly basis. Customers can book their accommodation by phoning 011 773 6566, 012 315 2090, 015 299 6205 or visiting your nearest station.
