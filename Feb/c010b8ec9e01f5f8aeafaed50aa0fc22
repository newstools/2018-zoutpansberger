Workers and employees at Checkers in Louis Trichardt started picketing on Monday in a bid to get their representatives' voices heard during the workers/employer's negotiations taking place today and tomorrow. A shop steward attached to the South Africa Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union (SACCAWU), Mr Alpheus Machete, said that the workers' representatives were locked in negotiations with their employers in the head offices in Johannesburg. “We are picketing only to demonstrate to the company to take into consideration all the submissions on the table as negotiations continue today and tomorrow,” Machete said. He stated that they were demanding a national framework agreement with the company. “This only refers to a signed agreement on work and working conditions, such as working-hour duration, leave stipulation, and on salary and salary adjustments, and more,” he said. Pickters carried plackards displaying: “Workers demands Sunday double overtime”; “We demand scheduled hours”; Workers demand late transport and safety after lock”; “Workers say Checkers [must] increase stock take money from R10.00 – R250.00”; “Workers demand better living wages to all workers”; and “Workers ask to be converted to permanent workers immediately”. Machete said that, after tomorrow's negotiations, shop stewards would be called for a meeting on the outcomes at a later stage, where the representatives would forge a way forward based on the outcome.
