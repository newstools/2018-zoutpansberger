The national budget had been tabled and we're still trying to make sense of the figures. A group of really clever programme developers decided to make life easier for the rest of us and built a little tool that tells us just how much of our worktime is spent on working for SARS. It's kinda depressing, but still interesting. All you need to do is to put your annual salary in the block and the tool will tell you how much more you will have to work to keep the taxman satisfied. (Well, at least for the next year)
