A Levubu police officer has been “brutally butchered” in full view of his young children. The 54-year-old W/O Thomas  Alugumi Nemugumoni was killed at his home in Tshakhuma Luvhalani Village on Monday (12th). According to provincial police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, Nemugumoni was attacked by an unknown man. He had allegedly just arrived home when the suspect pounced on him, stabbing him with a sharp instrument. Nemugumoni’s children heard frantic screams and were horrified to see the perpetrator killing their father right in front of their house. The killer fled the scene when the children started to call for help. The police and medical emergency services were called, but Nemugumoni was declared dead at the scene. The motive behind Negugumoni’s death is still unknown at this stage. He was working at the Levubu SAPS’s community service centre at the time of his death. "We have already established a dedicated investigation team, which will work tirelessly around the clock until the killer has been brought to book," confirmed the provincial police commissioner, Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba. He condemned the incident in the strongest words. The public were urged to assist the investigating team to help bring the killer of W/O Nemugumoni to book.
