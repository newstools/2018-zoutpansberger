The Louis Trichardt Rugby Club asked local supporters to make a mental note of their next home game on 21 July. This weekend, the club is playing away games against the University of Limpopo. The club’s next local clash would be against Univen on 21 July, followed by the last local game for the season against Letaba on 28 July. The last game will be an historic one as it will be the last game to played on the club’s old rugby fields before the club relocates to its new premises further down the Thohoyandou road. “We ask everyone to come and support the town’s players. The team are doing well in the Boet Fick league and the matches on 28 July promises to bring a fitting end to the local rugby club’s illustrious past before moving,” said the club management.
