Eskom issued a statement on Thursday afternoon stating that they will no longer be switching off Musina’s electricity supply on 6 July as announced earlier. Eskom’s planned power cut to Musina was due to outstanding debt owed by the municipality. “Eskom Holdings SOC Limited hereby notifies all parties who were materially and adversely affected by electricity supply interruptions to Musina Municipality that the interruptions have been suspended following the agreement reached between Eskom and the municipality,” stated Eskom in the release. They state that in terms of the agreement, the municipality made part payment and further committed to pay an additional amount by Monday, 09 July. “Eskom is obliged to supply electricity on a financially sustainable basis and may resume with electricity supply interruptions if Musina Municipality fails to honour any terms and the conditions that the parties have agreed on. In that event, the resumption of power interruptions, if necessary, will happen after a 14 days’ notice is issued,” Eskom stated.
