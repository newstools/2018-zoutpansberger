The Levubu police are investigating the circumstances that led to a horror crash which claimed the lives of three people who died on Wednesday afternoon. The accident occurred along the R524 road between Louis Trichardt and Thohoyandou near Ha-Ratombo farm at about 15:40. Three vehicles, namely a truck, sedan and bakkie, were involved in the crash. According to provincial police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, it is alleged that two of the vehicles, an Isuzu bakkie and a Mazda Midge, were travelling in the same direction on a piece of dual carriage road. At the end of this section of road, the two vehicles for some reason collided with each other. The force of the impact pushed both vehicles into the lane of on-coming traffic, causing a second crash with an on-coming truck. “The two occupants in the Mazda, a husband and wife, were certified dead at the scene, while a passenger in the Isuzu passed away on the way to hospital,” said Ngoepe. He added that another four people in the truck, including the driver, and the driver of the Isuzu were taken to hospital where they are recuperating. Ngoepe said that a case of culpable homicide was opened by the police. “The cause of this accident is subject to ongoing police investigations,” said Ngoepe.
