The team from Limpopo Dairy yet again showed their strength in local cricket when they beat Vikings by 86 runs on Sunday in the final of the Louis Trichardt Cricket Club’s 20-over league. Limpopo batted first and the two opening batsmen quickly put up a 50 partnership. Leon Olwage (23 off 22 balls) was the first to go when he got caught off the bowling of Leon Furstenburg. Chrisjan Hendriks then continued to demolish the bowling attack, scoring 74 off only 49 balls. Viking’s Pieter Kloppers then spearheaded a bit of a fight back, taking three wickets, but the runs kept flowing. Wouter Smit (40 not out from 26 balls) and TE Smit (20 from 16 balls) helped take the score to 177/5 after 20 overs. The best bowler for Vikings was Pieter Kloppers (3/20 in 4 overs). Kobus Barkhuizen took 1/5 in his one over. Craig Viljoen and Zander Volgraaff opened the batting for Vikings, but Chrisjan Hendriks quickly claimed both their wickets. Craig had some success, scoring 19 from 11 balls before he was caught. Leon Furstenburg looked promising, but with his score on 29 (from 32 balls), he was caught by Nimesh Whatekar off the bowling of TE Smit. The only other batsman who could score double figures was Glen McLeod (10). The final wicket fell in the 17th over with the score on 91. Limpopo’s “old fox”, Joubert Fourie, claimed most of the wickets, ending with 3/23 in 2.5 overs. TE Smit (2/9 in 2), Vimal Shah (2/12 in 4) and Chrisjan Hendriks (2/12 in 4) did the rest of the damage.
