The mayor of Makhado Municipality, Cllr Shonisani Sinyosi, and her team were out and about in town fixing potholes all over on Friday, 20 July, and she has vowed that she will be doing the same every Friday until all the holes are repaired. Together with her team, she inspected roads from Hlanganani Street to Songwozi and Grobler Street. In some places where the problem was more like missing pieces of road than potholes, she requested that some whole sections receive completely new surfaces within four weeks. Every Friday she will be visiting the entire area, including all townships and the R293, to focus on getting the town's and environing roads pothole free.
