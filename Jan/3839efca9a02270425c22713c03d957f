An early batting collapse on Sunday made life difficult for the Louis Trichardt cricket side, and they could not manage to set a competitive target in their match against Potties Old Boys. The visitors from Louis Trichardt batted first, but got off to a terrible start. Potties’ Wickus Prinsloo created most of the havoc and took 4/29 in 8 overs. He was supported by Nicky Oosthuizen, who took 2/31 in 5 overs. Between the two of them they removed five of Louis Trichardt’s top batsmen. Tovhi Nefale (14 not out) and Kobus Barkhuizen (22) then put up a good partnership to try and stabilise the ship, but after Kobus’s wicket fell, there was not much resistance left. Michael McNiccol finished off the tail, taking 3/7 in 3,3 overs. The visitors were bowled out in the 21st over with the score on 107. Louis Trichardt’s bowling attack inspired with their fighting spirit, but they were unfortunately left with too little to defend. The young AJ Fourie again impressed and in his spell of 6 overs he took 3/16. In the process, he got rid of Potties’ three top batsmen. Nicky Oosthuizen (33 not out), Robert Broodryk (14) and Rhynardt van der Merwe (12 not out) helped to take Potties’ score past 107. This coming Sunday, Louis Trichardt will travel to Tzaneen to test their strength against Hornbills.
