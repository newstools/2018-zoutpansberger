Residents experienced an extra quiet Sunday on 21 January, not because they wanted to, but because Louis Trichardt suffered a complete power outage. Fortunately, most people were able to enjoy their early breakfast coffee and a visit to church before the power unceremoniously went off just after 11:00. It soon proved to be no quick-fix situation, much to the dismay of many a housewife whose half-cooked Sunday lunch was left getting cold on the stove. With not much to do, many resorted to taking an extra early Sunday nap, but this too proved an effort as the extreme heat did not allow for a comfortable nap in the absence of a fan or air conditioner. For those able to get through to the municipality's disaster management office, answers were few with no clear indication of what was wrong and how long before the electricity supply would be restored again. Makhado municipal spokesperson Mr Louis Bobodi said on Tuesday that the power outage was caused by a broken conductor along the line that supplies the town. “The whole town was affected,” said Bobodi, adding that the fault had been on the municipality’s side. According to Bobodi, work had to be done at two locations to enable technicians to fix the fault. “The power was finally restored [to all parts of town] at 19:00,” said Bobodi.
