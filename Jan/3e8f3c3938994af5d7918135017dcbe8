Two suspects believed to be part of a wider vehicle-theft syndicate were remanded in custody, following their arrest by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Unit, Crime Intelligence and the SAPS Vehicle Identification Unit. The two men, Haajibu Ken Issah (30) and Adam Alli (24), appeared in the Louis Trichardt District Court on Monday after they were arrested on Saturday, 6 January, whilst allegedly driving a stolen Toyota Fortuner along the N1 between Musina and Louis Trichardt. It is suspected that they were en route to cross the Beit Bridge border post illegally. According to a spokesperson for the Hawks in Limpopo, Capt Matimba Maluleke, the vehicle allegedly had a falsified registration plate and licence disc. The Fortuner was reported stolen in December from Wayville in KwaZulu Natal. Following their brief court appearance, Issah and Alli were ordered to remain in custody. Their case was postponed until next week, 15 January, to afford the police time to finish their preliminary investigations.
