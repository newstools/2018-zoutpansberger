In spite of putting up a decent score of 212 runs in their clash against Polokwane Aces, Louis Trichardt Cricket Club’s first XI lost the match by eight wickets on Sunday. The visitors from Louis Trichardt opted to bat first and, thanks to the opening pair of Salim Patel (24) and AJ Fourie (41), were off to a good start. Craig Viljoen (22) and Leon Olwage (80) continued where they left off and the prospects looked promising. Leon was in devastating form and scored his 80 runs from only 42 balls. His innings included 11 fours and three sixes. Aces stuck to their guns and Lance Trueman eventually claimed Leon’s wicket. Trueman then proceeded to rip through the tail, taking six wickets while only conceding 27 runs in 5 overs. Only Kobus Barkhuizen (17 not out) weathered part of this storm, but he could only watch as the last wicket fell in the 33rd over with the score on 212. If Louis Trichardt thought they had a chance of winning the match, their hopes were quickly dashed by Aces’ opening pair. Chris de Klerk (66 not out) and a brilliant 135 by Stebian van der Walt took the match away from the visitors. Stebian’s century included seven sixes and 18 fours and was scored from only 95 balls. When Aces passed the score in the 34th over, two wickets were down. Thofhi Nefale claimed both and ended up with figures of 2/15 in 1,3 overs. Louis Trichardt will travel to Polokwane again on Sunday to play against Potgietersrus Old Boys. The team from the north desperately need a win, as they are lingering near the bottom of the log in the tough Premier League.
