Police in Thohoyandou have arrested one of their own following an incident at a petrol station where the police constable and two more suspects failed to pay for fuel. According to the provincial police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, the three suspects, between the ages of 25 and 37, swooped down on the Muledani Filling Station on Monday evening. They were driving a BMW with Gauteng number plates and requested to purchase petrol. The suspects paid with a bank card, but when the card was declined, they sped away and disappeared. Unfortunately for the suspects they were spotted by police, driving in their BMW, near Phiphudi Village. Preliminary investigations revealed that one of the suspects is a police constable attached to Pretoria Police Station. During the arrest, a blue police light was also confiscated from the suspects. “The suspects might be linked with numerous other criminal activities that were reported around the province. They will appear before the Thohoyandou Magistrate's Court soon on charges of theft under false pretence and possession of suspected stolen property,” said Ngoepe.
