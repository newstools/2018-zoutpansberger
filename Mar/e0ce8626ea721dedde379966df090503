Residents in Louis Trichardt had to kick of their Human Right’s Day celebrations on Wednesday with the news that there is no water being supplied to the town’s reservoirs. According to local DA (Democratic Alliance) ward councillor Mr Brian du Plooy, the Makhado Municipality, late on Tuesday afternoon enforced a decision to cut-off the electricity supply to the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM). This decision was allegedly taken due to the VDM’s non-payment of their electricity bill. The VDM is therefore now unable to pump water from the Albasini Dam. The exact amount due by the VDM could not be confirmed at the time this report was written. In the meantime residents have been urged to use water sparingly. Give us your views on this. Updates will be made available as the situation changes.
