Both the Makhado and Vhembe municipalities confirmed last week that the sewer system blockage at the abattoir on the corner of Byles and Van der Lith Street in Louis Trichardt had been fixed. Earlier in February, numerous complaints were received from surrounding businesses about the bloody mess and extreme stench caused by the blockage, because the run-off from the abattoir ended up in the street and adjacent wetland area as it has nowhere else to go. “The municipality’s technical team reported that the problem has been fixed and the environmental officer who visited the abattoir also confirmed that,” said Mr Matodzi Ralushai, spokesperson for the Vhembe District Municipality. Makhado Municipal spokesperson Mr Louis Bobodi added to this by stating that, after the blockage was cleared, the effluent was directed to the sewer line. “Currently the sewer line is running normally,” said Bobodi on 21 February. In the meantime, business owners in the area expressed the hope that the line will remain open, as these types of blockages are somewhat of a frequent occurrence in the area.
