Workers and employees at Shoprite in Louis Trichardt were picketing outside the store on Wednesday morning. The picket was the result of a disagreement between the South Africa Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union (SACCAWU) and the managing company of Shoprite over employees' salary increments, permanent and overtime hours and other benefits. According to the local SACCAWU representative, Ms Gertrud Makamunye, the union was concerned about employees who have had more than 15 years of service not being registered on the payroll as permanent staff and, as a result, not receiving a fair salary. Employees, she said, were being paid R20 per hour and demanded R38. On Wednesday, disgruntled employees and union members lined the entrance to Shoprite, waving placards with slogans such as “Saccawu demands a living wage” and “Company must respect workers' rights.” They indicated that they will continue with their peaceful strike until this coming Friday.
