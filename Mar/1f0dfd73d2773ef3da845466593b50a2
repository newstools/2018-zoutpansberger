The new league run by the Louis Trichardt Cricket Club started on a high note on Sunday when Strikers beat Vikings with 58 runs. Strikers batted first and thanks to a brilliant 53 runs scored from only 48 balls by Dirk-Pieter van den Berg, were off to a good start. Quinton Sillands (18) gave good support, but then wickets started falling. Riaan Hammann (15), Albertus Pieterse (21) and Ettienne van Heerden (24 not out) helped to take the score to 149/8 after 20 overs. Leon Furstenburg was Vikings’ best bowler, taking 3/24 in four overs. Louis van Jaarsveld took 2/29 in four overs. Vikings depended on their opening batsman, Craig Viljoen, to do the damage, and he did not disappoint. Craig scored a whirlwind 67 runs from only 29 balls. In the process he hit four sixes and six fours. Unfortunately for Craig it was a solo effort. None of his team mates could get close to double figures. Strikers’ bowlers collected wickets in quick succession and with the score on only 91 the batsmen were back on the side of the field. Ettienne van Heerden was the star of the match, taking 5/7 in 2,4 overs. Dirk-Pieter van den Berg also took an excellent 3/3 in two overs, which included the wicket of Craig Viljoen. Paolo Piorek was a bit more expensive, but took 2/25 in three overs. The match between Limpopo Dairy and Vikings that was scheduled for Saturday (17th) had to be postponed because of the rain.
