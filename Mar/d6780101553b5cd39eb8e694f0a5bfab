The local police were nothing short of horrified by a triple homicide that bears close resemblance to a scene from a mobster movie. This follows the discovery of three bodies on Monday, 12 March, near the secluded Matiyani Village along the Punda Maria road. The police suspect that the bodies might be linked to a kidnapping that was reported to them earlier in the day. According to the provincial police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, a man and woman were driving in a Toyota Tazz when they were kidnapped by an unknown number of people near the Makonde Village outside of Thohoyandou. “Afterwards, the murderer(s) loaded them inside the boot of their vehicle and drove away to a secluded area … they were fatally shot, set alight inside the vehicle and burnt beyond recognition,” said Ngoepe. The third body, that of a male, was found some metres from the crime scene. He had multiple gunshot wounds. The police are still stumped as to the motives behind what they have condemned as an act of unjustifiable barbarism. The investigation team has requested anyone with information that can assist with the apprehension of the perpetrators to contact Capt Richard Boshomane at Tel 079 894 5501.
