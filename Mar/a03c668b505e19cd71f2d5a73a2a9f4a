The Thohoyandou Stadium will be the best place for soccer lovers to be on Sunday afternoon, as the NFD league match between Black Leopards and Super Eagles will be staged there. While Black Leopards will be fighting with the aim of keeping their promotional playoff hopes alive, the situation is totally different for Super Eagles. The Free State side are not safe when it comes to relegation. They are in the fifth spot from the bottom of the log with 23 points, three above the tail-enders, Mthatha Bucks. Black Leopards lost only one of the six matches they have played under the guidance of Mr Joel “The Prophet” Masutha. It was announced that Leopards’ overlapping right back, Marks Munyai, would be available for selection on Sunday. Munyai was out of action for four weeks because of injury. The combination of Meshack Maphangule, Khuliso Mudau and Karabo Tsepo in the Leopards’ midfield is expected to keep the Eagles’ defence running for cover from the onset. Their strikers, Mwape Musonda and Thembisani Nevhulamba, are sharpened to kill. In other NFD matches on  Sunday, Mbombela United will host Jomo Cosmos at the Kanyamazane Stadium in Nelspruit. Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila will be away to play Royal Eagles at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg. Stellenbosch FC will entertain Real Kings at the Parow Park Stadium in Cape Town. Richards Bay FC will host the University of Pretoria at the Umhlatuze Sports Complex. In the three matches that will be played tomorrow, Ubuntu Cape Town will play against Mthatha Bucks at the Parow Stadium in Cape Town. Witbank Spurs and Highlands Park will test each other’s strength at the Puma Rugby Stadium in Emalahleni, while Uthongati FC and Cape Town All Stars will meet at the Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban.
