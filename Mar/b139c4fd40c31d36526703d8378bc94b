Could the eight-year-long court case of former regional magistrate Ronnie Rambau finally be drawing to a close? The Musina Magistrate's Court received the head of arguments from the case this week. Come this June, Rambau will know if he is guilty or not of corruption. Rambau stands accused of accepting a bribe to influence a court case, together with ex-prosecutor Estene Willemse and attorney Tivoneleni Edmond Lubisi. The trio was charged with corruption and conspiracy to commit corruption. They were arrested during a police trap in February 2010 for allegedly receiving bribes to influence the outcome of criminal cases such as murder and rape. During his previous court appearances, Rambau had asked the court to afford him the time to produce a witness that would supposedly testify about alleged agents within the South African Police and National Prosecuting Authority that had plotted to have Rambau arrested on bogus charges. According to Rambau, malicious intent was behind his prosecution. The court said, however, that Rambau had had ample time to state his case and granted the State’s application to close their case. He was afforded time until last week to produce his final witness, which he failed to do. Upon receiving both parties’ arguments, the court indicated that it would deliberate on the case until 28 June, when it is expected to give a verdict.
