In the ever-continuing battle against crime, the Makhado SAPS have warned residents to steer clear of secluded areas in Louis Trichardt. This follows a recent upsurge in the number of people who have been attacked while they were parked in areas that are known hotspots for criminal activities. One such a spot is the bushes at the top of River Street, where it turns into De La Rey Street. This spot is popular among “couples” who want some privacy when they want to spend some time alone in each other’s company. In recent weeks, many of these “couples” have fallen victim to ruthless thugs. In some cases, people have been robbed at knifepoint and one man was reportedly given a slash over the head by a robber. Sadly, however, these cases are not always reported to the police, for obvious reasons. Other hotspots that residents are being warned against include the subway corner of the N1 and Stubbs Street, as well as the area surrounding the railway crossing in Malherbe Street. One of the newer hotspots in town is the park bordering the Information Centre on the corner of the N1 and Songozwi Street. “We have some robbery cases that have been reported from there, especially at night and when it’s not busy,” said the spokesperson for the Makhado police, Const Irene Radzilane. “People park under the trees and in the bushes, and they should refrain from doing this,” Radzilane warned.
