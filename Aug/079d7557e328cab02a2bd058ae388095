Makhado police have yet to make an arrest following a daring armed robbery at the Pick n Pay store in Makhado Crossing in Louis Trichardt early Wednesday morning, 1 August. According to local police spokesperson Const Irene Radzilane, an unidentified man walked into the store just after opening at 09:00 pretending to be a client. He suddenly produced a firearm, grabbed a money bag from one of the female employees and fired a shot into the air. The man then ran towards the back of the store to exit through the receiving gate. He, however, got into a struggle with a security guard stationed at the gate. “He fired another two shots and managed to escape,” said Radzilane, adding that he got away in a silver Ford Focus that was parked at the back of the store. Radzilane said that the man got away with an undisclosed amount of money. Members of the local town watch also assisted the police following the robbery. “At this stage, no arrests have been made, but the police investigation is continuing,” said Radzilane. No-one was injured during the robbery.
