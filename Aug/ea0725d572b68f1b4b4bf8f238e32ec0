Main Line Passenger Services, the long-distance passenger rail service of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA), has announced the re-introduction of two train services between Johannesburg and Musina (via Polokwane), effective from 29 August. The announcement follows the re-introduction of the passenger rail service earlier this year, following an almost-four-year absence. According to PRASA, this service was withdrawn in 2014 as a result of the rationalisation of train services; however, due to popular demand, Main Line Passenger Services decided to reinstate the service. The train caters for Polokwane, Louis Trichardt, Musina and Zimbabwean customers crossing the border. As from 29 August, the Shosholoza Meyl will now be running twice a week from Johannesburg to Musina. On Wednesdays and Fridays, the train will depart from Johannesburg at 19:00, arriving in Polokwane at 03:44 and in Musina at 11:10. On Thursdays and Sundays, it will depart from Musina at 15:25, from Polokwane at 22:35 and arrive in Johannesburg at 05:44. The cost per person is R190 for the economy class and R310 for the tourist class. For more information or bookings, phone 011 773 3139, 012 315 2090 or 015 299 6205.
