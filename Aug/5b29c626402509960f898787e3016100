Two junior polocrosse players from Louis Trichardt, Jamin Schuch (under 14) and Istvan Schuch (under 16), were recently selected to represent South Africa in a recent international series played against a Barbarian team consisting of players from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Zambia. As part of the Limpopo Crusaders Polocrosse Club, brothers Jamin and Istvan competed at the tournament from 17 to 19 August at Shongweni in Natal. In a very close contest, the u/14 South African team beat the Barbarians by two matches to one. Jamin was awarded the best u/14 player overall in the series. He was also voted best South African player by the Barbarian team. The u/16 South African team lost the series to a very strong Barbarian team. Polocrosse is an equine sport where both horse and the rider are considered to be finely tuned athletes, and much hard work and training goes into the preparation of both horse and rider.  Horse care and wellbeing is a priority in this sport which can be played by all ages and levels of riders.
