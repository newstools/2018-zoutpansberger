Although it was advertised in the Zoutpansberger, many residents are still not aware that the Makhado Municipality’s emergency after-hours numbers have changed. In a notice issued at the beginning of July, the municipality states that, as from 1 August this year, the 24/7 municipal call centre (also emergency after-hours centre) will operate on a computerized system. “Kindly be notified that the new contact number for the 24/7 municipal call centre will be 087 350 2764. The previous contact numbers 015 516 2990/4/6 will thus no longer be in use as from 1 August and if it is used, a voice will refer the caller to the new number,” states the notice. Following the move to the new computerized system, the Zoutpansberger would like to know if any residents have tried it out, what they think of the new system and whether or not there was swift action regarding their “emergency”. Residents are welcome to let us know by sending us an e-mail to news@zoutnet.co.za, a WhatsApp to Andries at 082 603 2419 or commenting on the Facebook page of the Zoutpansberger.
