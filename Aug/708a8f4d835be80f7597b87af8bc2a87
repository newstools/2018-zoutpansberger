The Makhado Municipality have issued an urgent notice to inform residents that all services at the Dzanani Testing Station have been suspended until further notice. “This is due to a burglary and theft that occurred at the station on Friday, 10 August, and as a result, face value documents (i.e. for printing of vehicle registration certificates, vehicle licence discs, learners’ licences, as well as temporary licences and permits) together with an undisclosed amount of cash had been stolen,” read the notice issued by municipal spokesperson Mr Louis Bobodi. Bobodi said that currently all services suspended at this registering authority include all licensing related activities such as the booking of learner’s licences, driving licences, as well as the licensing of vehicles and the registration thereof. “Members of the community are therefore kindly advised to visit Makhado Registering Authority (Makhado Civic Centre) for the above mentioned services. We apologise for the inconveniences caused,” said Bobodi.
