The three suspects accused of trying to smuggle a large amount of explosives into the country through the Beit Bridge border post were yet again refused bail by the Musina Magistrate's Court on Monday. This court appearance was the three’s second since their arrest on 4 August. Murino Floyd (26), Tondorai Munthisi (33) and Tichavanwe Supai (37) were arrested after explosives were found in the truck they were travelling in. Their truck was stopped for scanning purposes and the authorities subsequently recovered 750 explosive blasting caps and three rolls of explosive cabling with an estimated street value of R300 000. “The origin and destination of these explosives are still being determined,” said provincial police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe. The three are charged with the illegal possesion of explosives and will again appear in court on 16 August, pending further police investigations.
