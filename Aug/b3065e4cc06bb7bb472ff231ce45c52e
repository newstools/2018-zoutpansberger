The three suspects who were arrested at the Beit Bridge border post on 4 August for being in possession of a large amount of illegal explosives appeared in the Musina Magistrate court yet again on Thursday, 16 August. It was Murano Floyd (26), Tindora Munthisi (33) and 37-year-old Tichavanwe Supai’s third court appearance since their arrest. They were again denied bail and their case postponed until 20 August for further police investigations.

The three were arrested after the truck they were travelling in was stopped at the border by SARS officials for scanning purposes. Upon scanning, authorities noticed something suspicious inside the truck and decided to investigate. This ultimately led to the discovery of a consignment of explosives with an estimated street value of R300 000. It consisted of 750 blasting caps and three rolls of explosive cable. The truck the three were traveling in was also confiscated by the police. Meanwhile, police have yet to determine the origin and destination of these explosives.
