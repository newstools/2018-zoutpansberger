Louis Trichardt High School's annual Bergfiets Brul on 31 August was promoted by the Makhado Care Group this year to help raise both awareness of and funds for victims of cancer and their families The Makhado Care Group works in the community and the greater Louis Trichardt area, raising money to assist local cancer patients and their loved ones. They not only raise funds but also provide whatever help they can when they see a need, whether physical, financial, or emotional. Events and fundraisers such as the Bergfiets Brul help the group to do as much as they do. Event organiser Renata Joubert said that they were also hoping to promote cycling as an activity. The whole school participates in this event, with various drives and activities. On the day, the cyclists rode in teams for the cause rather than for personal victory, as this cause is one very close to the hearts of this school’s students and teachers. Joubert and the Makhado Care Group particularly thanked KFC for their very generous support and great prizes, Premjee who donated snack bags for the riders, and Stanley Thompson for his much-appreciated work as MC for the event. The organisers put a lot of effort into the event and the school once again showed its team spirit in the fight to help and support cancer victims. Teams of 10 relay riders rode the varied course, which included a stretch down the sidewalk and through the front gates, where supporters shouted encouragement and ensured that cyclists slowed down a little for the sharp turn into the school gates on the way up to the sand section. More team supporters cheered encouragement from the benches on the field. This was an event where everybody won.
