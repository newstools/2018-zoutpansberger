Louis Trichardt resident Geoff Goetsch received the trophy as the overall winner in the Limpopo Champions League Shoot on Saturday, 15 September. The Northern Defensive Pistol Club, under the leadership of Wayne Coetsee, began the annual Champions League event in 2017, which is open to all members of the International Defensive Pistols Association (IDPA) clubs countrywide. The Limpopo League Club Trophy, however, can only be taken home by a club in Limpopo. The theme for this year’s shoot was Safari Gone Wrong and consisted of seven stages. Stage one was a typical anti-poaching scenario. Shooters had to search for illegal meat stashed in a poacher’s hideout. Targets were carefully hidden and proved tricky for competitors to find. Stage two involved high action, with the shooter exiting a vehicle to engage targets while following the course line of fire. Saving a “passed out” friend from hyenas wanting to make a meal of him was the theme of stage three, while stage four had competitors engaging with would-be robbers attacking a guest lodge. Stage five seemed to give the shooters a little break before the final, with targets being engaged in tactical priority from a seated position only. In stage seven, shooters turned heroes by having to rescue their significant others from bad guys, but only after first catching a fish from an actual boat. The final stage comprised standard, but still not easy, target shooting. Competitors enjoyed a well-deserved rest after a day filled with action, and a braai, with the prize-giving ceremony as the final highlight of the day. Goetsch took home the trophy by placing first among 30 competitors.
