An Atlas Oryx M-1 (SA-330) helicopter from Air Force Base Hoedspruit’s 19 Squadron was damaged in a crash landing during the South-African Air Force’s (SAAF) annual air-capability demonstration at the Roodewal Bombing range outside Polokwane on Tuesday. Air Force Base Makhado annually forms part of the demonstration. The exact cause of the crash landing, which occurred during a demonstration right in front of visiting dignitaries and members of the public, is being investigated. The spokesperson for the SAAF, Colonel Eugene Motati, stated afterwards that they were thankful that only one minor ankle injury had been reported. He emphasised that they were very happy with the reaction of the aircrew and the way that they had controlled the aircraft. “It could have been a lot worse if not correctly handled,” he said. He concluded that they would now await the findings of the board of inquiry. Once the dust cleared after the crash landing, it became clear that the Oryx had sustained severe damage. The tail boom had broken off at the attachment point to the fuselage. Yet the helicopter remained upright at landing, and the troops exited as had been planned for the demonstration. A video is currently circulating the Internet on YouTube, which was captured by a member of the crowd just seconds before the Oryx made its crash landing.
