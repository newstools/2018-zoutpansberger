While most residents of Louis Trichardt were sleeping safely in their beds, one brave man was fighting to save his young family. Craig Viljoen woke at 03:00 on the morning of Thursday, 20 September, to the screams of his wife who was with their one-year-old baby in the master bedroom of their home. Craig was in his three-year-old son’s bedroom at the time. On opening the bedroom door he came face to face with a knife wielding assailant. Craig didn’t think twice. Before the knife could connect with his body, he attacked. Not only did he wrest the knife from this particular intruder and a tyre iron from the second of the three home invaders, he gave them all a sound beating. Read the full story in next week’s paper and see why Natasha is so proud of her husband, and why this couple are so inspiring in the face of the ongoing onslaught by violent criminals in this district.
