Employees of the Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital, including nurses and general workers, want the chief executive officer of the hospital, Dr Irene Malatji, to resign and they accuse her of corruption, maladministration and nepotism. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, they participated in early morning and lunch-hour protests. Those involved include members affiliated to the National Health Education & Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa), Health & Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa) and the Public Servants Association (PSA). According to the deputy chairperson of Nehawu, Ms Linda Nthulane, they have received numerous complaints from the staff about maladministration and her attitude towards workers. “We are here to hand in a memorandum to management about the complaints we received from our members.” Nehawu’s local chairperson, Mr Mashudu Mabala, said that Malatji had failed to provide “strategic leadership”. According to him, factions in the hospital were negatively affecting the patients. He further said that service delivery had been severely compromised, due to the lack of leadership and the mismanagement of funds within the hospital. The district officer from the Department of the Health in Vhembe, Mr NR Nengudza, received the memorandum and promised the workers that he was going to submit it to the relevant officials and that they would respond. When asked for the comment, Malatji said that she was not allowed to comment and that the newspaper must call the provincial department.
