For the first time in its 28-year history, the annual Kremetart Cycle Race could not be hosted last year as a main sponsorship could not be secured. This situation was, however, unacceptable, not only for the Soutpansberg Cycling Club as organisers of the race, but also to the Soutpansberg community, who have been proud hosts of this annual event since the first race was held in 1990. Several businesses and organisations, mostly local, stepped up to the plate this year to sponsor the annual Krematert Cycle Race. They could also choose how big a sponsorship they would like to give, namely as a platinum sponsor, a gold sponsor, a silver sponsor, an affiliated sponsor or a Friends of the Soutpansberg Kremetart Cycling sponsor to deliver much-appreciated services and assistance during the race. This year’s platinum sponsors are 94.2 Jacarandafm, KFC, FNB, National Lotteries Commission, Zoutnet CC, Fresh Stop, Caltex, Lalapanzi Hotel, ZZ2, Leach Printers, Spar, PD Otto Elektries, MTG Funerals, PiB Professional Insurance Brokers and aQuelle. The gold sponsor is Limpopo Dairy, while Talisman Hire will act as silver sponsor. Affiliated sponsors include RootZ, Limpopo Tourism, Tahs-SA African Homestays, Qualito Craft Distillery, Alliance Fuel, DT Kitchens and Installations, Zwakala, Goodyear and Escape Cycle Tours. On the service side, the Friends of  Soutpansberg Kremetart Cycling include the Makhado Municipality, South African Police Service, Round Table Zoutpansberg 66, Louis Trichardt Rotary Club, Ladies Circle 4, Hoërskool Louis Trichardt and Cycle Centre.
