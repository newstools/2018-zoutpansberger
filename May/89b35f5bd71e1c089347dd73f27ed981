United Artists kept their title hopes alive by beating Govhu Black Bulls 2-0 in their MMK Administrators League match at the Lufule grounds on Sunday. Although they had nothing more than pride at stake, Black Bulls showed a great appetite for goals in the opening minutes of the game. Their front-runners, Austine Sithole and Collen Baloyi, missed clear chances within the first 10 minutes of the game. Sithole caused an upset in the fifth minute. He received a great pass from Godfrey Bila and unleashed from the edge of the box. The ball went a little wide. Collen Baloyi headed straight to the keeper moments thereafter, following a corner kick that was taken by Nyiko Makhubele. That was a wakeup call to the Artists’ defenders. They initiated numerous moves from the middle of the park. At that stage the visitors were chasing the action. The home side opened their account in the 18th minute. Thinandavha Mahase made no mistake, following a square pass from Emmanuel Murwamadala. Black Bulls lost cohesion in the middle of the park towards the end of the game. They were severely punished for that. Artists increased the tally in the 24th minute when Emmanuel Murwamadala dribbled past two defenders in a row before beating the keeper with a ground cutter. Thinandavha Mahase of Artists was warned with a card for a rough tackle on Erron Mabasa three minutes into the last half. Black Bulls tried their luck by Introducing Hlamulo Makhubele and Confidence Moyana for Mboni Baloyi and Nyiko Makhubele in the 59th minute. The replacements did not change the complexion of the game as Artists continued to dictate the terms. Hlamulo Makhubele and Erron Mabasa, both of Black Bulls, were reprimanded with cards for dangerous play later in the game.
