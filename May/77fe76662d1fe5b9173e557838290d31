The Khoroni Hotel, Casino and Convention Resort recently appointed Mr Elias Moduka as its general manager responsible for overseeing the smooth running of overall operations, which includes the full and efficient functioning of Khoroni’s gaming, hotel and support services. He began his career in the hospitality industry more than 20 years ago with a prominent South African resort hotel chain. He initially worked as a waiter and gradually grew his love and passion for the hospitality and gaming industries. During this time, he gained experience in food and beverage, surveillance and VIP services. “When the opportunity to join Khoroni as general manager presented itself, I grabbed it with both hands,” says Moduka. “To me, this opportunity was the culmination of decades of hard work, commitment and experience in the industry, and I am proud to assume my new role.” As part of his duties, he will also be responsible for establishing and maintaining good relationships with all group stakeholders, including staff, guests, unions, shareholders and community leaders. Moduka says he will also ensure the sustainability of the business through management of costs in a controlled and structured manner. “In this role, I would like to continue the legacy of the Peermont group and do my part to ensure that there’s continuous growth for the property. I hope to inspire my team to give their individual best efforts to ensure that, as a unit and a company, we make a positive impact in the industry. I would like to see my unit making a significant contribution to all stakeholders in terms of revenue, corporate governance, development and social investment,” says Moduka.
