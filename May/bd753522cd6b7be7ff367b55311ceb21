Parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee, which deals with the expropriation of land without compensation, will host public hearings on the subject, starting next month. This follows a motion passed by the National Assembly in February this year to consider reviewing Section 25 of the Constitution to enable land expropriation without compensation. The review committee’s teams will travel to all nine provinces, where they will hold at least three meetings per province in different venues. Parliament has also, in concurrence with the National Council of Provinces, extended the closing date for written submissions and requests for oral representations to Friday, 15 June. There will also be one final phase for oral submissions in Parliament from August 7 to 17. Presenters will be invited, based on the submissions received. In Limpopo, public hearings will be held at the following places: * Groblersdal, 27 June 2018 at the Elias Motsoaledi Local Municipality * Mokopane (Potgietersrus), 28 June 2018 at the Mokgalakwena Local Municipality * Giyani, 29 June 2018 at the Greater Giyani Local Municipality * Thohoyandou, 30 June 2018 at the Thulamela Local Municipality Details on how to submit a written submission can be found on Parliament's website here.
