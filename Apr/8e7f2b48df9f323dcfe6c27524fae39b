Three suspects, believed to have robbed a hardware shop in Dzanani yesterday morning (23rd), are behind bars. The police chased down the suspects all the way from Mphephu to Siloam. According to the provincial police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, the suspects swooped down on the hardware shop on Tuesday morning and robbed all the employees’ cellphones before fleeing the scene in a VW Jetta. “The getaway vehicle was spotted at Mavhoi Village, along the R523 road. A motor vehicle chase ensued until they reached the Matanda Village, where the three suspects, aged between 35 and 42, were cornered and arrested,” said Ngoepe. During the arrest, the police confiscated four vehicles, two 9mm firearms, balaclavas, gloves, two blue lights, and cash in the amount of R2 531. One of the vehicles, it was discovered, belongs to the South African National Defence Force’s VIP section. Another one of the vehicles was reported as hi-jacked in KwaZulu-Natal, while another was hijacked near Primrose in Gauteng. According to Ngoepe, the police strongly believe that the three suspects might be part of a syndicate. All three are expected to appear in the Dzanani Magistrate's Court later in the week.
