Local police in Musina not only recovered thousands of illegal cigarettes on Wednesday, but also arrested a suspected cigarette smuggler in the process. This arrest was preceded by the recovery of stolen vehicle, while it was in the process of being driven through the Limpopo River. Three suspects were trying to cross the river, into Zimbabwe, with a stolen BMW X3. Their efforts were interrupted by a dedicated task team, consisting of members of the Musina police and South African National Defence Force (SANDF), who followed up on a tip-off. All three the suspects abandoned the vehicle when they realized the police’s net was closing in on them. The vehicle was recovered by the police and taken to Musina. Afterwards the same team received information that three other suspects were driving in three rental vehicles, transporting illegal cigarettes. While the team were busy chasing down the suspects along the N1 north, one of the suspects sped off from the Baobab toll gate. This vehicle was later found abandoned along the Waterpoort road after the suspect lost control over his vehicle and it flipped on its side. The driver had already fled the scene. Inside the vehicle police found 714 cartons of illegal cigarettes. The police caught up with the second vehicle and suspect after they managed to force him of the road near Sebayeng, near Polokwane. The 38-year-old man was immediately arrested. Inside the vehicle police discovered 8 831 packets of illegal cigarettes. Both vehicles were also seized as part of the police’s investigation. The third suspect is still being tracked down. In the meantime the arrested suspect is expected to appear in the Mankweng Magistrate Court later in the week. The police have also appealed to public to assist them with their investigations in tracking down the suspects that escaped.
