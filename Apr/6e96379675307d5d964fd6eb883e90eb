Will the Beitbridge Border Post, between South Africa and Zimbabwe, be closed down? According to a Zimbabwean newspaper The Chronicle (read the full report here) there is currently a bid, by the International Cross Border Trader’s Association (ICTA), to close down the border. The paper reported on Tuesday that the ICTA’s request to protest inside the border area was turned down by security authorities from both South Africa and Zimbabwe. ICTA had allegedly planned to bring business to a standstill at the border from 16 to 17 April in a protest against alleged corruption at the border post. Security officials from both countries were on high alert, watching out for the protesters yesterday. No reports of violence have yet been received. Local police could not comment on this report at the time this article was written. If there are some of our readers in the area, please update us on the situation at the border.
