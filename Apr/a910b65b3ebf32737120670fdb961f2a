It was business as usual at the Beitbridge Border Post today, after a planned strike by the International Cross Border Trader’s Association (ICTA) did not proceed as planned. According to a Zimbabwean newspaper The Chronicle there was a bid by the ICTA to close down the border. The association requested to protest inside the border area, but it was turned down by security authorities from both South Africa and Zimbabwe. According to the Limpopo police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, the ICTA did bring a new application on Tuesday. The ICTA had allegedly planned to bring business to a standstill at the border from 16 to 17 April in a protest against alleged corruption at the border post. "The situation at the border is normal," Ngoepe said. Several readers informed the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Miror on Tuesday that they passed through the border without any hassles. That being said, the South African side of the border allegedly leaves little to be desired for travellers. “I can say the South African side needs to pull their socks up. When I went through last week Tuesday [10 April] it was total chaos compared to the Zimbabwe side which is sign posted as to what a person must do,” wrote Nicky Powick to the newspaper.
