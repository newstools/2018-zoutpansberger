A suspect was arrested over the weekend, suspected of running a vehicle theft syndicate in Limpopo. The 37-year-old man was arrested near Mashau Thenga Village, near Levubu on Saturday. According to police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, concerted efforts to deal with incidents of theft of motor vehicles and cross-border crimes in Limpopo, joint operations that were running until 15 April, continue to successfully crack the whip on such syndicates. According to Ngoepe the police’s task team acted on a tip-off they received from the community. During the arrest, five tipper trucks and three water tank trucks were confiscated. “The trucks are estimated at R24 million and preliminary police investigations have revealed that they were stolen in other provinces and were allegedly en-route to be smuggled out of the country,” said Ngoepe. The origins of the trucks are still being determined through ongoing police investigations. It was expected that the suspect will appear in the Levubu Magistrate’s Court on Monday (today).
