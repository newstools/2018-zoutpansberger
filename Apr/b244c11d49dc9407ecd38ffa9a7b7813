The nationwide bus strike is set to start on Wednesday, 18 April, the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council (SARPBC) confirmed on Tuesday. According to the SARPBC, the strike will affect passengers on short and long-distance journeys – with a few exceptions such as the Intercape service – across South Africa. Bus companies have urged passengers to make other arrangements, as well as for businesses to be flexible with their employees who will battle to travel to work tomorrow. The SARPBC, which represents nearly 80% of South Africa’s passenger buses, has approached the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) for assistance. The main reason for the strike is a dispute over wages. The unions’ key demands include a 12% across-the-board wage increase and a minimum basic wage of R8 000 a month. Taxis are expected to run as normal. Local readers are invited to share their experiences either by sending a WhatsApp to tel. 073 349 1587 or an email to isabel@zoutnet.co.za.
