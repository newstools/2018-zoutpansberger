Three suspects, of which one was identified as a recently retired Frelimo commander, were caught. The commander was allegedly kitted out in full camouflage at the time of his arrest. Rangers confiscated a high-calibre hunting rifle, ammunition, poaching equipment and a fresh set of rhino horns. The following day, rangers, with the help of a dog detector unit, tracked down another three suspected poachers and subsequently arrested them. "On the same day rangers also managed to arrest two additional suspects. Unfortunately, one suspected poacher was fatally wounded in the armed engagement," the statement said.

A heavy-calibre hunting rifle, ammunition, poaching equipment and two fresh rhino horns were recovered at the scene," SANParks said.
