A local resident and former attorney appeared in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate Court today after being accused of fraud and impersonating an attorney. The 46-year-old Samson Nkhangweleni Netshifhefhe was arrested on Wednesday (25th) by the Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit of the Hawks. He was, according to the Hakws’ spokesperson, Capt Matimba Maluleke, a practicing attorney in Thohoyandou until 2010 when the Limpopo High Court revoked his appearance privileges. Netshifhefhe’s name was struck from the attorney’s role after he allegedly embezzled money from the Road Accident Fund’s trust fund. Maluleke said this week that the Hawks received a tip-off from the public that Netshifhefhe was still claiming money from the fund on behalf of his clients. “Investigations revealed that he used his personal bank account to claim money from the road fund, and did not pay the beneficiaries. This resulted in him personally unduly benefiting over a million rand,” said Maluleke. After a brief court appearance, Netshifhefhe was granted R5 000 bail. He reportedly paid his bail and was released. His cause was postponed until 10 July.
