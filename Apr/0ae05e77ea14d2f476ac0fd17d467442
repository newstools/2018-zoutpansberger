The police in Limpopo have confirmed on Wednesday morning that the R81, travelling to places such as Giyani, Mooketsi and Polokwane, is again safe for motorists to travel on. They condemned the acts of a rowdy group of community members who embarked on protest action on Tuesday. The community of Hlanganani was apparently complaining about the lack of services. At first they barricaded the inner roads, and later went on the rampage and barricaded the R81 near Mooketsi with rubble and burning tyres. According to the provincial police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, the group’s actions caused serious public disturbances, including the disruption of schools and the flow of traffic. “Barricading roads during protest actions is a serious offence because it is tantamount to public violence and those who continue to engage themselves in these type of actions, are going to be dealt with harshly and without compromise,” warned the Limpopo Police Commissioner, Lt-Genl Ledwaba Nneke.
