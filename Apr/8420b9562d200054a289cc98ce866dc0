If names such as kuzu tandir, pide, köfte, kurufasulye and lachmacun do not mean anything to you, you must visit the Diversity Cultural Festival to be held in Eltivillas from Friday to Sunday. If you know that these names refer to traditional Turkish dishes, you will in all probability already have made a note of the event and you will be there. The festival is sure to attract a lot of visitors from all over the region. As an added attraction, a Turkish chef will be present to prepare the delicacies synonymous with the country that provided the world with taste experiences such as yogurt and the eggplant. The festival will start on Friday afternoon at about 15:00 and will last until Sunday night. No entrance fee will be charged. The Masjid Al Noor mosque in Eltivillas will be a beehive of activities, surrounded with stalls and fun activities for young and old. At the stalls, foods such as shawarma and adana kebabs will be on sale. Traditional Indian foods such as samosas and deg akhnee will further tickle the taste buds. The young ones will feel especially welcome with fun activities such as a jumping castle and pony rides. They will also have the opportunity to feed bunnies and chickens. For a bit of extra excitement, a strongman show will be held. The region’s national champion, Leon le Roux, will be in action, showing off his extraordinary strength. On a slightly more serious note, some of the region’s doctors have agreed to man a stall where free basic health check-ups will be done. This is done as a service to the community and visitors can pop in to make sure that the body is still in tip-top shape. The organisers of the event have extended a last-minute invitation to all other vendors who want to take up a stall at the festival. The only prerequisite for such vendors is that they may not sell food. Interested persons can contact Mazhar Goolam at 076-4308980.
