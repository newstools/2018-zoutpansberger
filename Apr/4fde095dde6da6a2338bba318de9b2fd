Police have determined that some of the vehicles, recovered in an operation to bust a suspected motor theft syndicate, were reported stolen in Modderfontein. The Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror reported earlier on the 37-year-old man that was arrested over the past weekend, suspected of being involved in the alleged syndicate. Ronald Chisana from Mambedi Valdezia appeared in the Vuwani Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges relating to the possession of suspected stolen vehicles. Chisana will remain in police custody until 23 April when he is expected to bring a formal bail application. According to a police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, concerted efforts were launched to deal with incidents of theft of motor vehicles and cross-border crimes in Limpopo. The joint operations that were running until 15 April helped them to successfully crack the whip on such syndicates, like the one Chisana is believed to be operating. According to Ngoepe the police’s task team acted on a tip-off they received from the community. During the arrest, five tipper trucks and three water tank trucks were confiscated. The trucks are estimated to be worth R24 million. Six of the eight vehicles were, according to Ngoepe, stolen in Modderfontein. Police investigators are still tracking the origins of the remaining two. “Preliminary police investigations have revealed that they were stolen in other provinces and were allegedly en-route to be smuggled out of the country,” said Ngoepe.
