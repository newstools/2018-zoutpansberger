Young Ebenezer Mulaudzi (19) and his friends Ndamulelo Nevhulaudzi, Muano Maregwa and Amen Munyai are young men with a vision. They have the dream that skateboarding, a relative unknown activity in Vhembe, will become popular in the region. As a starting point, the four pupils from a Thohoyandou secondary school, had organized and hosted a skateboarding tournament in the region last year. It was a resounding success, with clubs from as far as Polokwane taking part. To show their commitment to the development of this activity, this year a follow-up tournament was held last weekend. The Street Society #2 took place at the parking lot of the Thavhani Mall on Saturday. With their spine-chilling stunts, the boys were a marvel to watch for the hundreds of shoppers who visited the centre. The leader of the group, Ebenezer Mulaudzi, said that they changed from last year’s venue, the Thohoyandou Indoor Sports Centre, to a bigger, open venue. “With the support we are getting from businesses and organizations like Push Skateboarding in Cape Town, Aubs Motors and Diesel Centre at Tshisahulu and Golden Choice Kitchens at Shayandima, we are upping our game.” Mulaudzi said he was humbled by the support they received this year and thanked all who came to watch them and those who supported them financially. One of the supporters of the boys is Mr Nndwamato Sirwali, head of the Department of Health in the Vhembe District. “I am here because I subscribe to good health and this builds healthy bodies. I am also happy that most of the youth were taken away from the streets,” he said.
