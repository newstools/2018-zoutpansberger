The Limpopo Police confirmed on Friday that they have arrested nine suspects in connection with protests that disrupted traffic in the Mooketsi area earlier in the week. The community of Hlanganani was apparently complaining about the lack of services. On Tuesday they started to barricade local roads, including the R81 near Mooketsi. By Wednesday the protests spiralled out of control, when the community started to burn tyres. A small truck was also set alight, and burned to ashes. According to the provincial police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, the group’s actions caused serious public disturbances, including the disruption of schools and the flow of traffic. The nine suspects that were arrested was expected to appear in the Bolobedu Magistrate Court on Friday, 13 April on charges relating to public violence, malicious damage to property, armed robbery and possession of suspected stolen property. They condemned the acts of a rowdy group of community members who embarked on protest action on Tuesday. The community of Hlanganani was apparently complaining about the lack of services. At first they barricaded the inner roads, and later went on the rampage and barricaded the R81 near Mooketsi with rubble and burning tyres. “Barricading roads during protest actions is a serious offence because it is tantamount to public violence and those who continue to engage themselves in these type of actions, are going to be dealt with harshly and without compromise,” warned the Limpopo Police Commissioner, Lt-Genl Ledwaba Nneke.
