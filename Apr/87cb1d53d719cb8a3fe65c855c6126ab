Most matric girls already have a vision as to what their dream dress will look like when they step out on the night of their matric farewell. So, what if your dream dress could become a reality? Bargain Centre in Louis Trichardt has launched a competition in which two lucky winners can make a wish and have their dress sponsored. This competition was officially launched last week and has already attracted the attention of a lot of the matric girls of 2018. The competition is open to all Grade 12 girls that are registered in high schools in the Louis Trichardt area. Two lucky girls will each win a designer dress of their dreams. Bargain Centre not only has a fashion designer on hand that will help with the design of the dresses, but will also provide the material for the dresses from their new material selection. But what good is a sparkling new dress if you don’t look like a Hollywood star? That is why the prize package also includes a variety of beauty treatments. Apart from the designer dress, the two prize winners will also receive a hair appointment sponsored by De Cut and C Jay’s, make-up to be done by Daidas Beauty and The Beauty Corner, nail treatments from De Cut and Salon Finesse, a spray tan from Des@Dream Lean and a facial treatment from DoveBeauty@Jomien. To round everything off, Feminique Boutique has sponsored shoes and S Coetzee Photography will ensure that you have stunning photos to cherish afterwards. All that you have to do is to go get your entry form from Bargain Centre (24 Songozwi Street), make a wish and tell the judges why your matric dress should be sponsored. Creativity, the judges revealed, will go a long way in getting your entry noticed. “We want the entrants to make us sit up and take notice of their stories,” said one of the organisers, Mrs Heidi Alberts. Entries will close on 21 May and winners will be announced on 31 May. For more information, Bargain Centre can be contacted at Tel 015 516 0843.
