Anne Jacobs remembers clearly the day a year ago, while driving to Venda University, when she saw a tiny puppy wandering down the road. “It was the middle of nowhere,” says Anne, “and that little dog was just walking down the road in the most appallingly sad state. I couldn’t just drive past and leave him.” Anne stopped and picked up that very sick puppy, and so began his miraculous journey to the strong and loving dog that he has become only one year later. He now goes by the name of Capy. Anne tells of how Louis Trichardt vet Nada de Villiers made a huge effort to save Capy. The little dog did not have much of a chance to begin with. He had biliary and glandular fever, as well as terrible mange with a tertiary skin infection. In the hands of a determined vet, over the course of four days of care, which included shock treatment, Capy slowly healed and went to his new home with Anne, where he now remains happily. Anne and Capy shared many heart-warming quotes and thoughts with the Zoutpansberger, including these words of wisdom from Albert Einstein: “The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.” Anne and Capy encourage everyone to try to never look on and do nothing.
