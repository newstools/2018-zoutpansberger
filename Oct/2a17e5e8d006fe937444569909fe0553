Ridgeway Independent School hosted a Glam Recycle Fashion Show on 22 October in line with their drive to bring about awareness and provide solutions for the world’s growing problems. The school and college took a stand in September this year with their Ridgeway Rise for Climate Change concert where videos taken of the event were presented together with signed petitions at the Global Climate Action Summit in California. At that event, organizer Astrid Fourie said that the school would be approaching actual companies that pollute to encourage them to find cleaner ways to protect our children’s future. “The school continues to strive to encourage the children to care about their environment, global warming, climate change, pollution, and desertification being worsening problems. Children are our future and we need to educate them and provide them with skills to create positive changes.” With this in mind, Ridgeway Independent School hosted a Glam Recycle Fashion Show where children from Grade 1 to 7 participated. The aim was to educate children on the importance of recycling, the emphasis being to reduce, reuse and recycle. The judges, Stephanie Smith and Khanya Apelgren, said that they had had a difficult time choosing winners as all the children were so creative.
