An excellent century by Dewald Joubert helped Louis Trichardt Cricket Club score a convincing 173-run victory over Nirvana in the Limpopo Impala Cricket League on Sunday. The match was played at the Louis Trichardt oval and the home side batted first. The two openers, Leon Olwage (55) and Craig Viljoen (51), put up a 113-run partnership in fewer than 15 overs to set the stage. Dewald Joubert (100 from only 77 balls) was in devastating form, hitting no fewer than seven sixes. He received good support from Nimesh Watekar (15), Warno Smit (41), Jandré Hancke (21) and AJ Fourie (10). The last wicket fell in the 45th over, with the score at a very healthy 350. Nirvana Cricket Club’s best bowler was Tausif Kapcha, who claimed 5/42 in 8,2 overs. Mohsin Patel took 2/43 in his eight overs. Nirvana’s batsmen did not go down without an initial fight. The openers, Abdul Karim Sayed (49) and Asimm Bha (10) started well, and when Sameer Patel (59) joined Abdul, it looked as if the home side had their work cut out for them. Dirk van den Berg (2/29 in 8) claimed both Abdul and Asimm’s wickets, and this caused a mini-collapse. Mohsin Patel (11), Yacub Rangunwalah (13) and Altaf Desai (25) put up a bit of resistance, but the last wicket fell in the 32nd over with the score on 177. For Louis Trichardt, AJ Fourie (3/32 in 6,3 overs) and Craig Viljoen (3/43 in 7 overs) did most of the damage with the ball. This weekend, Louis Trichardt will have to travel to Phalaborwa to play against the Phalaborwa Cricket Club. The other home side, Eltivillas, will clash with Nkowankowa CC at the Eltivillas field. The result of the weekend’s match between Eltivillas and Phalaborwa CC was, unfortunately, not available at the time of our going to press.
